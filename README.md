Click on two cards to see if they match.  A match will turn green.  No match? The cards will turn over and you can keep playing.

Watch your stars! Too many clicks and you will start to lose your stars.  If you run out of stars...the game will end.  Don't worry you can always play again!

Test your brain!  Se if you can beat your time the mext go around.
