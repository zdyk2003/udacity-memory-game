# Memory Game Project

The second project for the Udacity Grow with Google Scholarship Front-End Developer Nanodegree program was a memory game.  The following languages were used to build this game:

<ul>
  <li> HTML </li>
  <li> CSS </li>
  <li> JavaScript </li>
  <li> jQuery </li>
</ul>

## How to play the game

Ready to test your memory?  Click here to <a href="https://zdyk2003.github.io/udacity-memory-game/"> PLAY! </a>

Click on two cards to see if they match.  A match will turn green.  No match? The cards will turn over and you can keep playing.

Watch your stars! Too many clicks and you will start to lose your stars.  If you run out of stars...the game will end.  Don't worry you can always play again!

Test your brain!  See if you can beat your time the next go around.
